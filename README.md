# Machine-Learning-project
# 1. Loading and Preprocessing
Load the dataset using libraries like pandas or numpy.
Explore the dataset for null values, data types, and outliers.
Perform necessary preprocessing:
Handle missing values (imputation, deletion).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).
Scale/normalize numerical features (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80%-20%).

# 2. Model Implementation
## Implement five regression algorithms:
Linear Regression: Use LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
Decision Tree Regressor: Use DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree.
Random Forest Regressor: Use RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Use GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn.ensemble.
Support Vector Regressor: Use SVR from sklearn.svm.
Train each model on the training dataset.

# 3. Model Evaluation
Evaluate all models using:
R-squared (R²): Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Penalizes errors linearly.

Summarize the evaluation metrics in a table for comparison.
Identify the best-performing model based on metrics and justify your selection.

# 4. Feature Importance Analysis
Use feature importance scores (for tree-based models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) or statistical tests (e.g., p-values for Linear Regression) to identify significant features.
Visualize feature importance using bar charts for interpretability.

# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning (2 Marks)
Perform hyperparameter tuning using:
Grid Search (GridSearchCV): Exhaustive search over a parameter grid.
Random Search (RandomizedSearchCV): Randomly samples parameters from a distribution.
Check if tuning improves performance metrics (e.g., R², MSE, MAE).
